Those that are redeemable on\\ndemand by the holder, at net asset value, are commonly known as“mutual funds” (or “open-end funds”). Most of these are activelyselling additional shares through a corps of salesmen. Those with\\nnonredeemable shares are called “closed-end” companies or funds;\\nthe number of their shares remains relatively constant. All of thefunds of any importance are registered with the Securities &\\nExchange Commission (SEC), and are subject to its regulations and\\ncontrols.*\\nThe industry is a very large one. At the end of 1970 there were\\n383 funds registered with the SEC, having assets totaling $54.6 bil-lions. Of these 356 companies, with $50.6 billions, were mutualfunds, and 27 companies with $4.0 billions, were closed-end.†\\nThere are different ways of classifying the funds. One is by the\\nbroad division of their portfolio; they are “balanced funds” if theyhave a significant (generally about one-third) component of bonds,\\nor “stock-funds” if their holdings are nearly all common stocks.\\n(There are some other varieties here, such as “bond funds,” “hedge\\n226* It is a violation of Federal law for an open-end mutual fund, a closed-end\\nfund, or an exchange-traded fund to sell shares to the public unless it has\\n“registered” (or made mandatory financial filings) with the SEC.\\n† The fund industry has gone from “very large” to immense. At year-end2002, there were 8,279 mutual funds holding $6.56 trillion; 514 closed-endfunds with $149.6 billion in assets; and 116 exchange-trade funds or ETFswith $109.7 billion.

When a fund earns high returns, investors\\nnotice—often pouring in hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of\\nweeks. That leaves the fund manager with few choices—all of thembad. He can keep that money safe for a rainy day, but then the low\\nreturns on cash will crimp the fund’s results if stocks keep going up.He can put the new money into the stocks he already owns—whichhave probably gone up since he first bought them and will becomedangerously overvalued if he pumps in millions of dollars more. Or he\\ncan buy new stocks he didn’t like well enough to own already—but hewill have to research them from scratch and keep an eye on far more\\ncompanies than he is used to following.\\nFinally, when the $100-million Nimble Fund puts 2% of its assets\\n(or $2 million) in Minnow Corp., a stock with a total market value of$500 million, it’s buying up less than one-half of 1% of Minnow. But ifhot performance swells the Nimble Fund to $10 billion, then an invest-ment of 2% of its assets would total $200 million—nearly half theentire value of Minnow, a level of ownership that isn’t even permissibleunder Federal law. If Nimble’s portfolio manager still wants to own\\nsmall stocks, he will have to spread his money over vastly more com-\\npanies—and probably end up spreading his attention too thin.\\nNo more fancy footwork.
